# The ndk-treasurehunt demo used to build on Windows 10. Then I switched to Ubuntu 16.04 and the whole thing stopped working.

The title says why I am doing this. This is the ndk-treasurehunt demo extracted from samples in gvr-android-sdk at googlevr.
It generates 3 variants of APKs for armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, and x86.
The armeabi-v7a apk is compatible with my Moto G5 Plus but it crashes on startup, so something is wrong with the build.
Unfortunately, I am not familiar with gradle and NDK enough to resolve this. Seriously no.
So I should probably ask a question on SO or gvr-android-sdk. I'll see how it goes.
